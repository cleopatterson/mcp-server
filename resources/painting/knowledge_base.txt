## Common Ambiguities & Resolution


### Initial Property Type Only
When customer only provides property type (e.g., "2 bedroom house"):
→ Ask: "Just checking — are you looking to paint inside, outside, or both?"

### Overlapping Surfaces:
- Deck/verandah painting → If timber deck: Interior/Exterior depending on location. If concrete: Concrete Painting
- Garage floor → Concrete Painting (if outdoor/exposed concrete) or Floor Painting (if finished indoor garage)
- External stairs → Concrete Painting (if concrete) or Exterior House Painting (if timber/attached to house)

### Ambiguous Terms
- "House painting" → Could be interior, exterior, or both - CLARIFY
- "Interior painting" → Could be full or partial - ASK SCOPE
- "2 rooms and a fence" → Special tasks (unrelated surfaces)
- "Whole house" → Confirm if interior, exterior, or both


## Question Flow Logic


### Priority Order
1. FIRST: Determine subcategory (what needs painting)
2. SECOND: Determine scope (full vs partial)
3. THIRD: Gather size details based on category
4. FOURTH: Surface/material specifics


### Efficiency Rules
- Ask ONE question at a time
- Skip questions already answered in initial input
- If customer said "full interior" don't ask about whole property
- If customer specified exact rooms, count them for sizing

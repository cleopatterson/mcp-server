# PAINTING CATEGORY KNOWLEDGE BASE


## Category Overview
Service Type: Painting
Primary Focus: Residential and commercial painting services including interior, exterior, roofs, and specialty surfaces


## Subcategory Definitions


### 1. INTERIOR HOME PAINTING
**Definition:** Rooms/areas inside a home (bedroom, bathroom, doors, hallways, kitchen, garage, granny flat, etc.)


**Size Determination:**
- For specific rooms:
  - Small: 1 room only
  - Medium: 2-4 rooms total
  - Large: 5+ rooms total
- For whole property:
  - Small: Studio
  - Medium: 1-3 bed apartment/townhouse
  - Large: 3+ bed house


**Essential Questions:**
1. If customer says "full/complete/entire/whole interior" → Ask: "What type of property and how many bedrooms?"
2. If customer lists rooms BUT unclear if that's everything → Ask: "Is this the whole property or just these specific rooms?"
3. If confirmed whole property → Ask: "What type of property is it - house, apartment, or townhouse?"
4. If property is a house → Ask: "Is it single or double storey?"
5. Then ask about surfaces: "Does this include ceilings, trims, and doors as well as walls?"


**Example Classifications:**
- "Living room and two bedrooms" = 3 rooms = Medium
- "Kitchen and bathroom" = 2 rooms = Medium
- "Master bedroom" = 1 room = Small
- "Full interior of 2-bed apartment" = Medium


### 2. EXTERIOR HOME PAINTING
**Definition:** Outside surfaces including external walls, cladding, weatherboards, eaves, trims, gutters, or external structures (garage/shed exterior)


**Size Determination:**
- Small: Partial exterior (single wall, just trims, gutters only)
- Medium: Full repaint of single-storey home OR compact two-storey
- Large: Full standard two-storey or larger


**Essential Questions:**
1. "Is this the full exterior or specific areas?"
2. If full exterior: "How many storeys?"


**Example Classifications:**
- "Front of house only" = Small
- "Full exterior single storey" = Medium
- "Complete two-storey exterior" = Large


### 3. HOME PAINTING
**Definition:** BOTH interior AND exterior painting of the same residential property. Single-surface jobs should be classified separately.


**Size Determination:**
- Small: 1-2 interior rooms + minor exterior touch-ups
- Medium: Partial interior + full exterior (or vice versa), OR full repaint of 2-3 bed home
- Large: Full interior + exterior repaint of 4+ bed home


**Essential Questions:**
1. "Does this include both interior and exterior?"
2. If yes: "What's included inside and outside?"
3. "How many bedrooms?"


**Important:** If only interior or only exterior mentioned, DO NOT classify as home painting


### 4. ROOF PAINTING
**Definition:** Any roof surface painting - tiles, Colorbond, metal, corrugated iron, etc.


**Size Determination:**
- Small: Touch-ups/repairs, shed roof, or single-storey granny flat
- Medium: Full roof of single-storey home
- Large: Multi-storey home or complex roof design


**Essential Questions:**
1. "Is this a full roof repaint or touch-ups?"
2. If full: "Single or multi-storey?"
3. If unclear: "Standard roof or complex design?"


### 5. FENCES AND FIXTURES
**Definition:** Standalone outdoor structures not part of main building - fences, gates, decks, verandahs, railings, pergolas, patios, driveways, carports


**Size Determination:**
- Small: Single small structure, fence <30m, deck/driveway <15m²
- Medium: Fence 30-60m, deck/driveway 15-40m², 2 structures combined
- Large: Fence >60m, deck/driveway >40m², OR 3+ structures


**Essential Questions:**
- For fences: "Approximate fence length in meters?"
- For surfaces: "Approximate area in square meters?"
- For multiple items: "How many structures need painting?"


### 6. FLOOR PAINTING
**Definition:** Indoor residential floors only (concrete, wood, epoxy coatings). Excludes outdoor surfaces.


**Size Determination:** SKIP - Do not collect size for floor painting


**Essential Questions:**
1. "Is this for indoor flooring?"
2. Focus on floor type and area/rooms


### 7. COMMERCIAL
**Definition:** Non-residential jobs - shops, cafes, offices, warehouses, factories, construction sites


**Size Determination:** SKIP - Do not collect size for commercial jobs


**Essential Questions:**
- Focus on type of commercial property and scope of work


### 8. SPECIAL TASKS
**Definition:**
- Unusual/specialty items (furniture, bulkheads, chimneys, kitchen cabinets, residential carpark line marking)
- Jobs combining two unrelated categories (e.g., bedroom + fence, roof + deck)
- EXCEPTION: Interior + exterior of same home = "Home painting" NOT special tasks


**Size Determination:** SKIP - Do not collect size for special tasks


**Essential Questions:**
- Focus on understanding specific items/surfaces rather than size


## Common Ambiguities & Resolution


### Initial Property Type Only
When customer only provides property type (e.g., "2 bedroom house"):
→ Ask: "Just checking — are you looking to paint inside, outside, or both?"


### Ambiguous Terms
- "House painting" → Could be interior, exterior, or both - CLARIFY
- "Interior painting" → Could be full or partial - ASK SCOPE
- "2 rooms and a fence" → Special tasks (unrelated surfaces)
- "Whole house" → Confirm if interior, exterior, or both


## Question Flow Logic


### Priority Order
1. FIRST: Determine category (what needs painting)
2. SECOND: Determine scope (full vs partial)
3. THIRD: Gather size details based on category
4. FOURTH: Surface/material specifics


### Efficiency Rules
- Ask ONE question at a time
- Skip questions already answered in initial input
- If customer said "full interior" don't ask about whole property
- If customer specified exact rooms, count them for sizing
